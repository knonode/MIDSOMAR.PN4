    <h1>MIDSOMAR.PN4</h1>
    <p>
        MIDSOMAR.PN4 is an experimental recursive video art project. The series are inspired by mathematics and 
        shows a big Midsommar (Summer solstice) bonfire from the beginning to the end in small video clips and still images.
        The footage was done by me in 2024 while in company of fellow artists. Some of the clips shows transcription of conversations 
        as they happened during filming.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 77 NFTs, indexed from nr.0 to nr.76, where nr.0 is in 77 editions (supply), nr.1 has 76 supply 
        and so on until last NFT nr.76 with supply of one. 
        Total supply is 3003, which is a palindrome and a pn4 number with factors of 3x7x11x13.
    </p>
    <p>
        The clips were semi-randomly filmed during the progression of the bonfire with duration of about 10 +-3 seconds. 
        During editing they were shortened in duration to the first lowest factor (3, 7, 11 and 13 seconds). 
        So that a clip with duration 9 seconds was shortened to 7 seconds, and a clip with duration 14 seconds was shortened to 13 seconds.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        So there are:<br>
        5 clips à 13 seconds<br>
        31 clips à 11 seconds<br>
        17 clips à 7 seconds<br>
        24 clips à 3 seconds<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Combining naturally occurring pseudo-randomness,(as I had no specific plan at the moment of filming or had any control of the flow of conversation) 
        with a game of numbers inspired by prime numbers, recursion, palindromes and cryptology,
        I intend to shuffle the <strong>3003</strong> NFTs at <strong>1 Algo</strong> each.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holders can combine <strong>3, 7, 11 or 13</strong> of clips together to receive a longer part of the whole as a new NFT from the creator. The parts used for creating a merged video will be burned. 
        Eventually, only one whole film can be made, since the last part of the whole exists in edition of one. The other pieces, combined or in their original form can become unique as well, depending on how many will be burned and their original supply.
